Creating a basic throwback blog generator
Alex

# My First Journal Entry

The throwback blog generator was a fun node exploration.  There is no shortage of bare bones blog generators, but I thought it would be fun to create my own.  My requirements were:

- Write blog entries in markdown
- A simple build process that converts markdown into HTML
- No (or very minimal) javascript on the front end. I wanted this blog to be _actually_ super lightweight.
- One click deploy


## Tools Used

You can see the repo for this blog [here](https://github.com/asieke/sieke-journal).  Outside of the basic node/express packages, I used `marked` to convert markdown to HTML and `highlight.js` to do syntax highlighting for the markdown.

## End Result

The basic file structure of the app is below.  A build script `build.js` runs and compiles everything in the markdown directory into static HTML files which are output to the public/ directory.  Some default CSS styles the HTMLified markdown to resemble the markdown you'd see in a standard Github README.  The build script also updates the table of contents in index.html.

```bash
├── build.js
├── index.js
├── markdown
│   └── 2021-12-21.md
├── package.json
├── public
│   ├── index.html
```


## Fun Learnings

Doing syntax highlighting in the exported HTML was super easy thanks to markdown + highlight.js
This code runs during the build process + then some basic css is required to style the HTML.

```javascript
marked.setOptions({
  renderer: new marked.Renderer(),
  highlight: function (code, lang) {
    const hljs = require('highlight.js');
    const language = hljs.getLanguage(lang) ? lang : 'plaintext';
    return hljs.highlight(code, { language }).value;
  },
  langPrefix: 'hljs language-', // highlight.js css expects a top-level 'hljs' class.
  pedantic: false,
  gfm: true,
  breaks: false,
  sanitize: false,
  smartLists: true,
  smartypants: false,
  xhtml: false
});
```

One click deploy was accomplished with the following script.  Learned some silly bash / github scripting that enabled me to add a commit message with the current date.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js",
    "deploy": "node build.js && git add . && git commit -m \"updated: `date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`\" && git push origin master && git push heroku master"
  },
```

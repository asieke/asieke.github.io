Creating a basic throwback blog generator
Alex

# My First Journal Entry

The throwback blog generator was a fun node exploration.  There is no shortage of bare bones blog generators, but I thought it would be fun to create my own.  My requirements were:

- Write blog entries in markdown
- A simple build process that converts markdown into HTML
- No (or very minimal) javascript on the front end. I wanted this blog to be _actually_ super lightweight.
- One click deploy


## Tools Used

You can see the repo for this blog [here](https://github.com/asieke/sieke-journal).  Outside of the basic node/express packages, I used `marked` to convert markdown to HTML and `highlight.js` to do syntax highlighting for the markdown.

## End Result

The heavy lifting of the build process is all encapsulated in one file that takes care of parsing the markdown and generating an HTML file in the public directory.  The entire site is now simply static HTML.
